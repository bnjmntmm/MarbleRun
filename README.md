## Marble Run

Marble Run was a Mixed Reality Project made in Godot 4.1.2 to try out the Engines capabilites in VR.
The Main Goal is to build the largest track and have the marble land in the finish. At the End the Player can submit their Score to an online Leaderboard.

## Known Issue

Godot 4.1.2 had a bug that only the mobile renderer worked with the Quest 3 and therefore the performance suffered in our case. 
Also, the game starts to stutter when you get over a certain number of building blocks
